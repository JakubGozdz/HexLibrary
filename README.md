# Hex Library

It is a JAVA implementation of a simple hex library made by <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/">Amit
Patel</a> from <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">Red Blob Games</a> who wrote a bunch of great articles about
hexagon grids:

<li><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">Guide Hexagonal Grids</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html">Implementation of Hex Grids</a></li>
</ul>
Which I studied, and analyzed his implementation, method by method, line by line to better understand the topic.
